1. Project Overview

Introduction:
This project focuses on monitoring the electrical consumption (in kilowatt-hours) at a workplace using the RX380 power meter, with the goal of identifying which locations consume the most electricity at specific times. The solution is cost-effective, targeting small and medium enterprises (SMEs) or hobbyists with limited budgets, particularly in Southeast Asia. By collecting and analyzing this data, companies can better manage their energy consumption and make informed decisions on energy efficiency.

The proof of concept (PoC) phase is already complete, demonstrating successful communication between the RX380 and a Raspberry Pi 5 using Python code. Data is being transferred from the RX380 to the Raspberry Pi and then stored in an MSSQL server, with further plans to integrate a dashboard using Node-RED for real-time data visualization.

This project is ongoing, with future plans to explore different controllers such as the PiControl CM4 Industrial Controller, which may be better suited for environments where Raspberry Pi 5 is not ideal.

Audience:
The project is intended for:

Engineers and technicians in small to medium enterprises (SMEs) seeking a low-cost solution for power monitoring.
Hobbyists or individuals involved in industrial automation with limited resources.
Researchers and developers looking to collect and analyze energy consumption data for small-scale industrial or commercial setups.
